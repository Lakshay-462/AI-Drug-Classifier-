PharmaNet: AI-Driven Drug Mechanism Classifier


PharmaNet is an advanced neural network-based project designed to classify drug mechanisms from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. This application demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence in pharmaceutical research, providing a robust framework for identifying mechanisms such as enzyme inhibitors, receptor agonists, and more.

Features
Neural Network Implementation: Custom-built in C++ with efficient activation functions, backpropagation, and training mechanisms.
SMILES Feature Extraction: Converts SMILES strings into meaningful input features for the neural network.
Drug Mechanism Prediction: Predicts mechanisms across five categories:
Enzyme inhibitor
Receptor agonist
Receptor antagonist
Ion channel modulator
DNA intercalator
Dataset Integration: Includes synthetic datasets for training and testing.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have:
1) A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
2) A terminal or IDE to compile and execute the program.
